## I. Banks provide liquidity -- A story

### A simple world
We are in a simple world. At period ``t=0`` there are is a big population, where each person owns 1 kg of potatoes (the _initial endowment_ is 1).

#### Preferences
At this moment ``(t=0)``, nobody is hungry. Everybody knows that they will be hungry _at some point_. But they don't know _when_ -- either in period ``1`` or period ``2``.

The utility of an agent is 
```math
\begin{cases}
	u(c_1) & \text{with probability }\gamma \\
	u(c_2) &\text{with probability }1-\gamma
\end{cases}
```

#### Investment opportunities

There are two options. Either store the potatoes or **plant** potatoes to grow more of them. **Storage** has a gross return of ``1`` (no gain, no loss) and the _stored potatoes_ are a **liquid** asset. They can be eaten in either of the two periods. Each kilogram of **planted** potatos yield ``1.5`` kilograms of potatoes in period 2. (The gross return is ``R=1.5`` if _held to maturity_.) Planted potatoes are an **illiquid asset**. If you dig up the planted potatoes in the intermediate period they will have lost their quality and not be very enjoyable. So, in case of _early liquidation_ the gross return is ``r \in [0, 1)``.

### Investment decision of an agent

Each agent can split up their initial endowment (1kg of potatoes), plant fraction ``x`` and store fraction ``1 - x``. When the agents wakes up hungry in period 1, the agent will dig up (_liquidate_) the planted potatoes and have a consumption of ``c_1 = (1-x) + r x``. If the agent wake is not hungry in period 1, she will keep the ``x`` potatoes in the ground, and the ``(1-x)`` potatoes in the storage and have a consumption of ``c_2 = (1-x) + R x`` in period 2.

### The role of a bank

Agents _deposit_ their initial potatoes in the bank. The investment decision is delegated to the bank, who promises a fixed return ``(c_1, c_2)`` depending on the time of withdrawal.

The banks know that the fraction ``\gamma`` of people will withdraw in period 1 (because they are hungry) and ``(1-\gamma)`` will withdraw in period 2. The bank needs to make sure that ``c_2 \geq c_1``, otherwise _late_ agents have an incentive to withdraw their deposits in period 1 (and store them until period 2).

We assume that banks act on a competitive market, so agents will only choose to deposit in a bank that provides the _optimal contract_. Thus, banks will only operate if they maximize

```math
\begin{align}
& \max_{x, \ell \in [0,1]} \gamma u(c_1) + (1-\gamma) u(c_2) \\
&\begin{aligned}
\text{such that } &&    \gamma c_1 &= (1-x) + ℓ r x \\
				  && (1-\gamma) c_2 &= (1-ℓ) R x \\
	  			  && c_2 &≥ c_1
\end{aligned}
\end{align}
```

This problem is the same as the _planner's problem_, except that the incentive compatibility constraint (IC) ``c_2 \geq c_1`` is added. It turns out, that under some conditions for the utility function `u` the IC will always be satisfied. So the presence of banks will lead to the welfare-maximizing outcome in this model.

## II. Financial fragility (Bank runs)

What will happen, if a fraction ``\tilde \omega > \omega`` withdraws money in period ``t=1``? The bank will have to dig up some of its potatoes to fill the gap. This means that the payout in period two will have to be reduced (there are not enough potatoes left). As soon as the expected payout ``\tilde c_2`` becomes small enough, there will be a **bank run**. If the ``\tilde c_2 < c_1`` the incentive compatibility constraint is violated and the "late" types will start to withdraw their money.

## III. Risk-sharing in the interbank market

Now, let's suppose that there are ``N`` banks. All banks face the same decision problem, so they will offer the same deposit contract ``(c_1, c_2)``. Agents will randomly pick one of the two banks the outcome will be the same as before.

Let ``\omega_i`` be the fraction of bank ``i``'s customers that withdraws early. The average fraction of withdrawers is ``\gamma = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \omega_i``. We assume that there is **idiosychratic** (i.e. bank-specific) **risk**, but **no aggregate risk**.  That is, banks don't know ``\omega_i``, but they know ``\gamma``.

Banks can serve at most ``\gamma`` early withdrawals without liquidating assets. If they are faced with ``\omega_i > \gamma`` early customers, the bank as excess liquidity needs of ``(\omega_i - \gamma) c_1`` in period 1. If faced with ``\omega_i < \gamma`` early customers, the bank has excess liquidity in period 1, but a shortage of funds of ``((1-\gamma) - (1-\omega_i))c_2 = (\omega_i - \gamma)c_2`` in period 2. Since ``0 \leq \omega_i \leq 1``, the maximal liquity need in period 1 is
```math
(1 - \gamma) c_1
```


Suppose banks can deposit at the same terms as agents. So for each unit deposited, agents get ``c_1`` if withdrawn in period ``t=1`` and ``c_2`` if withdrawn in period ``t=2``. Now suppose that each has total deposits of ``\bar y = 1-\gamma``.
