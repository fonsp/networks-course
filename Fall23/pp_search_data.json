Step 2: Run Julia After installing,  make sure that you can run Julia . On some systems, this means searching for the “Julia  1.8.2 ” program installed on your computer; in others, it means running the command  julia  in a terminal. Make sure that you can execute  1 + 1 : Make sure that you are able to launch Julia and calculate  1+1  before proceeding! Step 3: Install  Pluto Next we will install the  Pluto , the notebook environment that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia  programming environment  designed for interactivity and quick experiments. Open the  Julia REPL . This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot. Here you type  Julia commands , and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result. To install Pluto, we want to run a  package manager command . To switch from  Julia  mode to  Pkg  mode, type  ]  (closing square bracket) at the  julia>  prompt: \njulia> ]\n\n(@v 1.8 ) pkg>\n The line turns blue and the prompt changes to  pkg> , telling you that you are now in  package manager mode . This mode allows you to do operations on  packages  (also called libraries). To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to  add  (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet.\nYou should only need to do this  once  for each installation of Julia: \n(@v 1.8 ) pkg> add Pluto\n This might take a couple of minutes, so you can go get yourself a cup of tea! You can now close the terminal. Step 4: Use a modern browser: Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome We need a modern browser to view Pluto notebooks with. Firefox and Chrome work best. Second time:  Running Pluto & opening a notebook Repeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project or homework assignment. Step 1: Start Pluto Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type: julia> using Pluto\n\njulia> Pluto.run()\n The terminal tells us to go to  http://localhost:1234/  (or a similar URL). Let’s open Firefox or Chrome and type that into the address bar. If you’re curious about what a  Pluto notebook  looks like, have a look at the  Featured Notebooks . These notebooks are useful for learning some basics of Julia programming. If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look a the  JuliaCon presentation . If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again. And please let us know! Step 2a: Opening a notebook from the web This is the main menu - here you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our homework assignments will always be based on a  template notebook , available in this GitHub repository. To start from a template notebook on the web, you can  paste the URL into the blue box  and press ENTER. For example, homework 0 is available  here . Go to this page, and on the top right, click on the button that says “Edit or run this notebook”. From these instructions, copy the notebook link, and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box. The first thing we will want to do is to save the notebook somewhere on our own computer; see below. Step 2b: Opening an existing notebook file When you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off. If you want to run a local notebook file that you have not opened before, then you need to enter its  full path  into the blue box in the main menu. More on finding full paths in step 3. Step 3: Saving a notebook We first need a folder to save our homework in. Open your file explorer and create one. Next, we need to know the  absolute path  of that folder. Here’s how you do that in  Windows ,  MacOS  and  Ubuntu . For example, you might have: C:\\Users\\fons\\Documents\\18S191_assignments\\  on Windows /Users/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on MacOS /home/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on Ubuntu Now that we know the absolute path, go back to your Pluto notebook, and at the top of the page, click on  “Save notebook…” . This is where you type the  new path+filename for your notebook : Click  Choose . Step 4: Sharing a notebook After working on your notebook (your code is autosaved when you run it), you will find your notebook file in the folder we created in step 3. This the file that you can share with others, or submit as your homework assignment to Canvas. \nconst run = f => f();\nrun(async () => {\nconst versions = await (await fetch(`https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json`)).json()\nconst version_names = Object.keys(versions).sort().reverse()\nconst stable = version_names.find(v => versions[v].stable)\nconsole.log({stable})\nconst pkg_stable = /\\d+\\.\\d+/.exec(stable)[0]\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"auto-julia-version\").forEach(el => {\n    console.log(el)\n    el.innerText = el.getAttribute(\"short\") == null ? stable : pkg_stable\n})\n});"},{"url":"search/","title":"Search results","tags":[],"text":"window.init_search(); Search Results \nLoading..."},{"url":"sidebar data/","title":"sidebar data","tags":[],"text":"Dict main \"welcome\" collections \"welcome\" .pages, \"Julia basics\" collections \"julia basics\" .pages, \"Networks basics\" collections \"networks basics\" .pages, \"Diffusion on Networks\" collections \"diffusion\" .pages, \"Financial networks\" collections \"financial networks\" .pages, , about Dict authors name \"Fabian Greimel\", url \"https www.greimel.eu\" , name \"Simon Trimborn\", url \"https www.simontrimborn.de\" , title \"Networks in Economics and Finance\", subtitle \"Theory, Computation and Data\", term \"Spring 2024\", institution \"University of Amsterdam\", institution url \"http www.uva.nl\", institution logo \"uva logo.svg\", institution logo darkmode \"uva logo.svg\" "},{"url":"syllabus/","title":"Syllabus","tags":["welcome"],"text":"Syllabus Course Links official Canvas course page Class schedule Lecture Title Date Lecturer Notebooks Reading 1A Network Basics 1 Feb  7, 2022 Cees basic Julia ,  first networks Jackson Ch. 1 & 2 1B Network Basics 2 Feb 10, 2022 Cees coauthor network ,  power law ,  exercises Jackson Ch. 3 1C Random Networks Feb 11, 2022 Cees notebook Jackson Ch. 4–6 & 11 2A Tutorial 1: Twitter Feb 14, 2022 Cees notebook 2B Learning on Networks Feb 17, 2022 Cees notebook Jackson Ch. 8 2C Disease Transmission Feb 18, 2022 Cees notebook 3A no lecture Feb 21, 2022 3B Financial networks 1 Feb 24, 2022 Fabian notebook Allen & Gale (2000) 3C Financial networks 2 Feb 25, 2022 Fabian notebook Acemoglu et al.

Children have a much lower probability of getting hospitalized. Would it still make sense to close schools to keep hospitalizations low? We construct a network of adults and children, where children are linked via schools, adults in their jobs and parents are linked to children. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We assume that `child`ren and `adult`s differ by their transition probabilities. Children do not get hospitalized ``\\chi 0`` , and they have a higher recovery rate ``\\rho``. All these parameters are made up. \"\"\" transitions df DataFrame member type \"child\", χ 0.0, ρ 0.4 , member type \"adult\", χ 0.4, ρ 0.3 md\"\"\" We also make assumptions about the transmission probabilities within families, workplaces and schools. \"\"\" transmission df DataFrame linktype family, p 0.3 , linktype school, p 0.3 , linktype work, p 0.3 md\"\"\" Task 1 Introduce hospitalized into the model 3 points 👉 Add a new state `H`ospitalized. \"\"\" begin abstract type State end struct S State end susceptible struct I State end infected struct H State end hospitalized struct R State end recovered end md\"\"\" 👉 Add a transition rule for `H`.

Without taking any measures the model predicts that the total number of people who will be hospitalized will exceed the maximum capacity. In order to prevent this from happening, your options are to announce a lockdown of either schools or workplaces on a pre specified set of future days from day 0. Lockdown days of schools are economically more costly than lockdown days of workplaces. Therefore, it is important to obtain insights on how effective school lockdowns are in terms of preventing the spreading of Covid 19. In this assignment you will use simulation of the spreading of Covid 19 under various scenarios to extract those insights, and subsequently formulate a motivated lockdown policy based on these insights. \"\"\" T 30 md\"\"\" Now it's your turn. 👉 Decide when you want to lockdown schools and adjust the cell below.

Banks provide liquidity A story A simple world We are in a simple world. At period ``t 0`` there are is a big population, where each person owns 1 kg of potatoes the initial endowment is 1 . Preferences At this moment `` t 0 ``, nobody is hungry. Everybody knows that they will be hungry at some point . But they don't know when either in period ``1`` or period ``2``. The utility of an agent is ```math \\begin cases u c 1 & \\text with probability \\gamma \\\\ u c 2 &\\text with probability 1 \\gamma \\end cases ``` Investment opportunities There are two options. Either store the potatoes or plant potatoes to grow more of them. Storage has a gross return of ``1`` no gain, no loss and the stored potatoes are a liquid asset. They can be eaten in either of the two periods. Each kilogram of planted potatos yield ``1.5`` kilograms of potatoes in period 2. The gross return is ``R 1.5`` if held to maturity . Planted potatoes are an illiquid asset . If you dig up the planted potatoes in the intermediate period they will have lost their quality and not be very enjoyable. So, in case of early liquidation the gross return is ``r \\in 0, 1 ``. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Investment decision of an agent Each agent can split up their initial endowment 1kg of potatoes , plant fraction ``x`` and store fraction ``1 x``. When the agents wakes up hungry in period 1, the agent will dig up liquidate the planted potatoes and have a consumption of ``c 1 1 x r x``. If the agent wake is not hungry in period 1, she will keep the ``x`` potatoes in the ground, and the `` 1 x `` potatoes in the storage and have a consumption of ``c 2 1 x R x`` in period 2. ```math \\begin align &\\max x \\mathbb E U c 1, c 2 \\gamma u c 1 1 \\gamma u c 2 \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text such that & c 1 1 x r x \\\\ & c 2 1 x R x \\end aligned \\end align ``` \"\"\" u log 𝔼U c₁, c₂ γ γ u c₁ 1 γ c₂ sliders md\"\"\" ``R`` bind R Slider 0.5 0.05 1.5, default 1.1, show value true ``r`` bind r Slider 0.0 0.05 1.0, default 0.1, show value true ``\\gamma`` bind γ Slider 0.0 0.05 1.0, default 0.5, show value true \"\"\" sliders let function obj x γ γ c₁ 1 x x r c₂ 1 x x R 𝔼U c₁, c₂ γ end res maximize obj, 0, 1 x opt Optim.maximizer res info x opt xx 0.0 0.05 1.0 fig Figure ax Axis fig 1,1 , xlabel L\"fraction invested x \", ylabel \"expected utility\" lines ax, xx, obj. xx vlines ax, x opt, linestyle dash, loose , color gray fig end md\"\"\" If the return from liquidation r is sufficiently low, agents will not invest in the liquid asset x 0 . The fact that nobody is investing in the asset is not very satisfying. Isn't it somehow possible to predict how many agents will be hungry in period 2 ? Then we could invest at least plant some potatoes and distribute the returns somehow. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The social optimum What would a benevolent social planner do? The planner can collect all initial endowments, make an investment decision and distribute the proceeds. The planner maximizes the ex ante expected utility of an agent. ```math \\begin align & \\max x, \\ell \\in 0,1 \\gamma u c 1 1 \\gamma u c 2 \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text such that && \\gamma c 1 & 1 x \\ell r x \\\\ && 1 \\gamma c 2 & 1 \\ell R x \\end aligned \\end align ``` \"\"\" c₁ x, ℓ γ γ 1 x ℓ x r γ c₂ x, ℓ γ γ 1 ℓ x R 0.0 ? 0.0 1 ℓ x R 1 γ function obj args γ γ x, ℓ args 𝔼U c₁ x, ℓ γ , c₂ x, ℓ γ γ end social optimum let neg obj args obj args res optimize neg obj, 0.0, 0.0 , 1.0, 1.0 , 0.5, 0.5 , Fminbox GradientDescent x opt, ℓ opt Optim.minimizer res x opt, ℓ opt, c₁ opt c₁ x opt, ℓ opt γ , c₂ opt c₂ x opt, ℓ opt γ end let x opt, ℓ opt social optimum xx range 0.0, 0.99, 100 ℓℓ 0.0 0.05 1.0 objj obj x, ℓ for ℓ ∈ ℓℓ, x ∈ xx fig Figure ax Axis fig 1,1 , xlabel \"fraction invested\", ylabel \"expected utility\", title latexstring \"expected utility for \\ \\\\ell^ round ℓ opt, digits 4 \\ \" ax Axis3 fig 1,1 , xlabel \"fraction invested\", ylabel \"fraction liquidated\", zlabel \"expected utility\" surface ax, ℓℓ, xx, objj lines ax, xx, obj x, ℓ opt for x ∈ xx vlines ax, x opt, linestyle dash, loose , color gray fig end sliders md\"\"\" We can see that in the social optimum, there is a significant investment into the liquid asset. We can also see, that the optimal expected utility is higher than in the individual optimum above. In the real world, there is no benevolent social planner. So the question is How can we achieve the social optimum? TL DR banks. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The role of a bank Agents deposit their initial potatoes in the bank. The investment decision is delegated to the bank, who promises a fixed return `` c 1, c 2 `` depending on the time of withdrawal. The banks know that the fraction ``\\gamma`` of people will withdraw in period 1 because they are hungry and `` 1 \\gamma `` will withdraw in period 2. The bank needs to make sure that ``c 2 \\geq c 1``, otherwise late agents have an incentive to withdraw their deposits in period 1 and store them until period 2 . We assume that banks act on a competitive market, so agents will only choose to deposit in a bank that provides the optimal contract . Thus, banks will only operate if they maximize ```math \\begin align & \\max x, \\ell \\in 0,1 \\gamma u c 1 1 \\gamma u c 2 \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text such that && \\gamma c 1 & 1 x ℓ r x \\\\ && 1 \\gamma c 2 & 1 ℓ R x \\\\ && c 2 &≥ c 1 \\end aligned \\end align ``` This problem is the same as the planner's problem , except that the incentive compatibility constraint IC ``c 2 \\geq c 1`` is added. It turns out, that under some conditions for the utility function `u` the IC will always be satisfied. So the presence of banks will lead to the welfare maximizing outcome in this model. \"\"\" let x opt, ℓ opt social optimum xx range 0.05, 0.95, 100 fig Figure ax1 Axis fig 1,1 , xlabel L\"fraction invested x \" ax2 Axis fig 2,1 , xlabel L\"fraction invested x \" lines ax1, xx, c₁. xx, ℓ opt , label L\"c 1\" lines ax1, xx, c₂. xx, ℓ opt , label L\"c 2\" lines ax2, xx, 𝔼U. c₁. xx, ℓ opt , c₂. xx, ℓ opt γ , label L\"\\bbE U\" vlines . ax1, ax2 , x opt, linestyle dash, loose , color gray axislegend. ax1, ax2 linkxaxes ax1, ax2 hidexdecorations ax1, grid false fig end md\"\"\" II. Financial fragility Bank runs What will happen, if a fraction ``\\tilde \\omega \\omega`` withdraws money in period ``t 1``? The bank will have to dig up some of its potatoes to fill the gap. This means that the payout in period two will have to be reduced there are not enough potatoes left . As soon as the expected payout ``\\tilde c 2`` becomes small enough, there will be a bank run . If the ``\\tilde c 2 c 1`` the incentive compatibility constraint is violated and the \"late\" types will start to withdraw their money. \"\"\" begin x opt, ℓ opt, c₁ opt, c₂ opt social optimum liquid ℓ 1 x opt ℓ x opt r withdrawal ω c₁ opt ω end md\"additional withdrawers ε bind ε Slider 0 0.01 1 γ , default 0.05, show value true \" ω γ ε liquid ℓ opt withdrawal ω withdrawal ω ≤ liquid ℓ opt function realized payout ω, opt ib payable 0.0, ib deposit 0.0 x opt, ℓ opt, c₁ opt, c₂ opt opt liquid ℓ 1 x opt ℓ x opt r ib payable withdrawal ω c₁ opt ω shortfall0 max withdrawal ω liquid 0.0 , 0.0 if 0 ≤ shortfall0 ≤ ib deposit ib withdrawal shortfall0 else shortfall ib deposit ib withdrawal ib deposit end info shortfall0 shortfall shortfall0 ib withdrawal ℓ new clamp shortfall x opt r , 0.0, 1.0 c₁ new c₁ x opt, ℓ new, γ max γ, ω c₂ new c₂ x opt, ℓ new, γ max γ, ω if c₂ new c₁ new && ω 1.0 IC violated everybody withdraws early ω̃ 1.0 return ω, delete realized payout ω̃, opt , ω ... end ω, c₁ opt, c₂ opt, ℓ opt, c₁ new, c₂ new, ℓ new end realized payout ω, social optimum let ε 0.2 ib deposit 0.2 bank1 realized payout γ ε, social optimum ib deposit bank2 realized payout γ ε, social optimum ib deposit chain bank1 bank2 begin DataFrame select ω, ℓ new, ib withdrawal end end md\" hidden cell \" sliders 1.1, 0.4. 0.5 let df map 0 0.005 1 do ω ε ω γ ε, realized payout ω, social optimum ... end | DataFrame chain df begin select Not ω stack Not ε transform astable begin tmp split variable, \" \" variable tmp 1 mod tmp 2 \"opt\" ? \"planned\" \"realized\" end data mapping ε \"additional withdrawers ε\", value, color variable, linestyle mod \"\" visual Lines draw end end md\"\"\" III. Risk sharing in the interbank market Now, let's suppose that there are ``N`` banks. All banks face the same decision problem, so they will offer the same deposit contract `` c 1, c 2 ``. Agents will randomly pick one of the two banks the outcome will be the same as before. Let ``\\omega i`` be the fraction of bank ``i``'s customers that withdraws early. The average fraction of withdrawers is ``\\gamma \\frac 1 N \\sum i 1 ^N \\omega i``. We assume that there is idiosychratic i.e. bank specific risk , but no aggregate risk . That is, banks don't know ``\\omega i``, but they know ``\\gamma``. Can the social optimum still be achieved? TL DR Yes, if there is an interbank market \"\"\" md\"\"\" Banks can serve at most ``\\gamma`` early withdrawals without liquidating assets. If they are faced with ``\\omega i \\gamma`` early customers, the bank as excess liquidity needs of `` \\omega i \\gamma c 1`` in period 1. If faced with ``\\omega i \\gamma`` early customers, the bank has excess liquidity in period 1, but a shortage of funds of `` 1 \\gamma 1 \\omega i c 2 \\omega i \\gamma c 2`` in period 2. Since ``0 \\leq \\omega i \\leq 1``, the maximal liquity need in period 1 is ```math 1 \\gamma c 1 ``` Suppose banks can deposit at the same terms as agents. So for each unit deposited, agents get ``c 1`` if withdrawn in period ``t 1`` and ``c 2`` if withdrawn in period ``t 2``. Now suppose that each has total deposits of ``\\bar y 1 \\gamma``. \"\"\" md\"\"\" illustration missing \"\"\" let ib deposit 0.2 ω γ 0.2 shortfall0 max ω c₁ opt γ c₁ opt, 0.0 if 0 ≤ shortfall0 ib deposit ib withdrawal shortfall0 c₁ c₁ opt ℓ 0.0 shortfall 0.0 elseif shortfall0 ≤ ib deposit x opt r ib withdrawal ib deposit shortfall shortfall0 ib withdrawal ℓ shortfall x opt r γ ω c₁ c₁ opt else ib withdrawal ib deposit ℓ 1.0 c₁ liquid ℓ ib withdrawal ω end ζ excess liquidity liquid ℓ ib withdrawal ω c₁ ζ next next period c₂ opt ω γ ζ next, ib withdrawal, ω, ℓ, c₁, ζ, shortfall0, shortfall end md\"\"\" Appendix \"\"\" md\"\"\" Package environment \"\"\" md\"\"\" Graphs \"\"\" md\"\"\" Numerical Methods \"\"\" md\"\"\" Data \"\"\" md\"\"\" Plotting \"\"\" md\"\"\" Other \"\"\" TableOfContents "},{"url":"financial-networks/systemic-risk/","title":"Systemic risk in financial networks","tags":["financial-networks"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.22 frontmatter chapter 5 section 2 order 1 title \"Systemic risk in financial networks\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" description \"\" tags \"financial networks\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils This Pluto notebook uses bind for interactivity.

Stability and Resilience \"\"\" md\"\"\" 1. More interbank lending leads to less stability and less resilience Formally, for a given regular financial network `` y ij `` let ``\\tilde y ij \\beta y ij `` for ``\\beta 1``. Financial network ``\\tilde y`` is less resilient and less stable see Proposition 3 . Proposition 3 More interbank lending leads to a more fragile system. For a given network topology, the defaults are increasing in ``\\bar y``. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 2. Densely connected networks are robust, yet fragile Our results thus confirm a conjecture of Andrew Haldane 2009, then Executive Director for Financial Stability at the Bank of England , who suggested that highly interconnected financial networks may be “robust yet fragile” in the sense that “within a certain range, connections serve as shock absorbers and connectivity engenders robustness.” However, beyond that range, interconnections start to serve as a mechanism for the propagation of shocks, “the system flips to the wrong side of the knife edge,” and fragility prevails. Upto some ``\\varepsilon^ ``, the shock does not spread Above this value, all banks default This is an example for a phase transition it flips from being the most to the least stable and resilient network Compare Propositions 4 and 6 Proposition 4 For small shocks and big ``\\bar y``, the complete network ist the most resilitient and most stable financial network and the ring is the least resilient and least stable. Proposition 6 For big shocks, the ring and complete networks are the least resilient and least stable. \"\"\" A 0.5 md\"\"\" Assignment \"\"\" md\"\"\" Task 1 6 Points \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 1.1 | 2 points Consider financial network ``\\tilde y``.

To call it we must use parentheses \" f f 10 md\"For longer functions we use the following syntax with the `function` keyword and `end` \" function g x, y z x y return z^2 end g 1, 2 md\" For loops\" md\"Use `for` to loop through a pre determined set of values \" let s 0 for i in 1 10 s s i end s end md\"Here, `1 10` is a range representing the numbers from 1 to 10 \" typeof 1 10 md\"Above we used a `let` block to define a new local variable `s`. But blocks of code like this are usually better inside functions, so that they can be reused. For example, we could rewrite the above as follows \" function mysum n s 0 for i in 1 n s s 1 end return s end mysum 100 md\" Conditionals `if`\" md\"We can evaluate whether a condition is true or not by simply writing the condition \" a 3 a 5 md\"We see that conditions have a Boolean `true` or `false` value. We can then use `if` to control what we do based on that value \" if a 5 \"small\" else \"big\" end md\"\"\"Note that the `if` also returns the last value that was evaluated, in this case the string `\"small\"` or `\"big\"`, Since Pluto is reactive, changing the definition of `a` above will automatically cause this to be reevaluated \"\"\" md\" Arrays\" md\" 1D arrays `Vector`s \" md\"We can make a `Vector` 1 dimensional, or 1D array using square brackets \" v 1, 2, 3 typeof v md\"The `1` in the type shows that this is a 1D array. We access elements also using square brackets \" v 2 v 2 10 md\"Note that Pluto does not automatically update cells when you modify elements of an array, but the value does change.\" md\"A nice way to create `Vector`s following a certain pattern is to use an array comprehension \" v2 i^2 for i in 1 10 md\" 2D arrays matrices \" md\"We can make small matrices 2D arrays with square brackets too \" M 1 2 3 4 typeof M md\"The `2` in the type confirms that this is a 2D array.\" md\"This won't work for larger matrices, though. For that we can use e.g.\" zeros 5, 5 md\"Note that `zeros` gives `Float64`s by default. We can also specify a type for the elements \" zeros Int, 4, 5 md\"We can then fill in the values we want by manipulating the elements, e.g. with a `for` loop.\" md\"A nice alternative syntax to create matrices following a certain pattern is an array comprehension with a double `for` loop \" i j for i in 1 5, j in 1 6 md\"\"\" Appendix \"\"\" TableOfContents "},{"url":"julia-basics/more-julia/","title":"More Julia","tags":["julia-basics"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.22 frontmatter chapter 1 section 2 order 1 title \"More Julia\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" description \"\" tags \"julia basics\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils using DataFrames using DataFrameMacros using Chain chain using PlutoUI md\"\"\" `more julia.jl` | Version 1.1 | last updated May 10 2022 | created by Daniel Schmidt https github.com danieljschmidt \"\"\" md\"\"\" More Julia \"\"\" md\"\"\" The purpose of this notebook is to make you familiar with Julia syntax that is frequently used in the course material. It also points out the peculiarities of Pluto notebooks. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Named tuples and keyword arguments Named tuples Like many other programming languages, Julia allows you to create tuples. The elements of tuples can be accessed by using the corresponding index \"\"\" standard tuple 1, 2 standard tuple 1 md\"\"\" Julia also has named tuples. Just like standard tuples, named tuples allow you to access an element using its index, but alternatively you can also access an element by its name. \"\"\" named tuple a 1, b 2 named tuple.a md\"\"\" This is convenient because it means that you do not need to remember if some parameter is the first element in a tuple or the second one. Below you can see an alternative way of creating named tuples that is frequently used in the course material \"\"\" let a 1 named tuple2 a, b 2 a is equivalent to a a end md\"\"\" Keyword arguments A similar syntax with a semicolon is used for keyword arguments that are identified by name and not by their position as normal function arguments \"\"\" function some function a, b 1 return a b end some function a 3, b 5 let a 3 some function a, b 5 a is equivalent to a a end md\"\"\" Vectorization with dot syntax You can apply a function to all elements of a vector by using the dot syntax \"\"\" 1,2,3 .^ 2 log. 1,2,3 md\"\"\" Note how Julia usually does things in a way that's mathematically consistent. Look at the following code. \"\"\" A ones 3, 3 exp A exp. A A^2 A .^ 2 md\"\"\" What would Python, R or Matlab do? \"\"\" md\"\"\" The pipe operator The pipe operator | makes it possible to write down nested function calls in a more readable way. For example, the two expressions below do the same thing \"\"\" round log named tuple.b named tuple.b | log | round md\"\"\" In case you use R The | operator in Julia is similar to the % % operator in R. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Working with data Here are a few simple examples of working with DataFrames in Julia. If you are familiar with pandas, dplyr or Stata, have a look at this cheatsheet https dataframes.juliadata.org stable man comparisons . Also, have a look at the documentation of DataFrameMacros.jl https jkrumbiegel.github.io DataFrameMacros.jl stable which makes working with DataFrames much more convenient. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Creating a `DataFrame` \"\"\" df1 DataFrame x 1 10 md\"\"\" Transforming mutating a column \"\"\" transform df1, x ByRow x sqrt x transform df1, sqrt x uses transform from DataFrameMacros.jl md\"\"\" The ``` chain``` macro \"\"\" md\"\"\" The ``` chain``` macro works similar to the pipe operator. In the code for this course, the ``` chain``` macro is often applied to data frames together with macros from the ```DataFrameMacros``` package. \"\"\" df2 DataFrame A 1,2,2,1 , B randn 4 md\"\"\" Consider the data frame above. Let's say you would like to add up the values in the B column separately for each value of A take the absolute value of the resulting sums of B values. Using the ``` chain``` macro, we can perform this task with relatively concise code \"\"\" chain df2 begin groupby A combine sum B , automatically named C sum B specify name transform abs C end md\"\"\" Without the ``` chain``` macro, the code would look like this \"\"\" begin df groups groupby df2, A df sum combine df groups, sum B , C sum B transform df sum, abs C end md\"\"\" Unicode characters You can use Greek letters and other Unicode characters in your Julia code. For example, type \"\\alpha\" in the cell below without the quotation marks and press Tab on your keyboard. This should create an \\alpha symbol. \"\"\" md\"\"\" See the Julia documention https docs.julialang.org en v1 manual unicode input for a list of supported Unicode characters. For Greek letters, the abbreviations are the same as in LaTeX. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The \\in symbol An elegant way of writing loops is to use the \\in symbol instead of writing \"in\". The \\in symbol can be created by typing \"\\in\" and pressing Tab. \"\"\" i^2 for i ∈ 1 5 md\"\"\" Pluto notebooks General advice Press F1 to see shortcuts for Pluto notebooks. Ctrl Click on an underlined variable or function to jump to its definition. Use the Live docs in the bottom right corner to get more information about any Julia function or object. Check the Github wiki https github.com fonsp Pluto.jl wiki for more information on Pluto notebooks. Automated updating of cells When changing a function or variable, Pluto automatically updates all affected cells. For example, change the value of d to some other number and see how the following cell updates automatically \"\"\" d 5 d 10 md\"\"\" This is different from jupyter notebooks in which you have to update related cells manually. The automated updating the advantage that you do not have to keep in mind the order in which to evaluate cells. However, it can also be annoying if some of the affected cells take a long time to run. At the time of writing, there is no way to turn off the automated updating but you can always manually disable cells with long run times by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of a cell. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Only one expression per cell Pluto notebooks only allow one expression per cell. If you nevertheless want to place several expressions into the same cell, you have to use a begin ... end block \"\"\" begin e 10 f e 5 end md\"\"\" Cannot reuse variable names \"\"\" md\"\"\" Use `let` blocks to specify variable names locally. \"\"\" let g 3 end g md\"\"\" Deactivate cells \"\"\" ╠═╡ sleep 5 ╠═╡ md\"\"\" Imported Packages \"\"\" TableOfContents g 1 g 2 "},{"url":"networks-basics/coauthors/","title":"Co-authorship network","tags":["networks-basics"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.36 frontmatter chapter 2 section 2 order 1 title \"Co authorship network\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" tags \"networks basics\" description \"\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils using Graphs using GraphDataFrameBridge using GraphMakie using CairoMakie using NetworkLayout using DataFrames using CSV CSV using PlutoUI TableOfContents, FilePicker md\"\"\" `view ti network.jl` | Version 1.3 | last updated Feb 7, 2022 \"\"\" md\"\"\" The Co Authorship Network of the Tinbergen Institute \"\"\" md\"\"\" We next analyze the network of co authorship relations between economists at the Tinbergen Institute.

The time it takes to plot a big network is mainly driven by the layout algorithm. That's why I choose the boring Shell algorithm, where all nodes are placed on a circle. This is very fast. If you want, you can try to plot this with the default layout algorithm.
